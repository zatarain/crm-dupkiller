We have a problem with our users in our CRM, specifically Braze, the problem is that we have a lot of duplicated users that are registered from several channels (e. g. our website, facebook, fanfinders, third-party partners, etc), Could you please make a deduplication tool to connect with a CRM like Braze and remove duplication users in smart way without losing users information and flag which channels they come from?

I'd like to understand your deduplication requirements better to build the most effective solution for your Braze CRM.

What criteria should the system use to identify duplicate users? For example, should it match on email address, phone number, a combination of fields, or use fuzzy matching for names and addresses?




User avatar
You can use email address, phone numbers, device id (GUID)

Perfect! So we'll match users based on email address, phone numbers, and device IDs.

What should happen when the system finds duplicates with conflicting information? For example, if two user records have the same email but different names, addresses, or other profile data - should we keep the most recent information, merge all non-empty fields, or use some other strategy to preserve the most complete user profile?




User avatar
Yes, we can keep the most recent information in the standard attributes, but also adding a custom attribute with a JSON object with the diff and the channel name

Excellent! So we'll keep the most recent standard attributes and create a custom attribute containing the historical differences and channel information.

One final question: How do you want to handle the deduplication process - should this be a one-time cleanup tool that you run manually, or would you prefer an ongoing system that automatically detects and merges duplicates as they're created (like a webhook-based solution that processes new users in real-time)?




User avatar
I would like the system detects and merge automatically, but also like to have a manual way to do it and a way to unmerge based on the diff that we saved before

Perfect! Now I have all the requirements to create a comprehensive Braze deduplication system. Let me create the specification for your project.

Created
SPEC.md
I've created a comprehensive specification for your Braze user deduplication system! The spec covers:

Key Features:

Automatic duplicate detection using email, phone, and device ID matching
Smart merging that keeps the most recent information while preserving historical data
Custom attribute storage with JSON diffs and channel tracking
Manual merge/unmerge capabilities
Real-time webhook processing for new users
Comprehensive audit trail
Core Components:

REST API with endpoints for scanning, merging, unmerging, and configuration
Database schema to track merge operations and store user diffs for unmerge functionality
Braze API integration for user management
Webhook handlers for automatic processing
Smart Merge Strategy:

Preserves the most recent standard attributes
Creates a deduplication_history custom attribute containing all merged user info, channels, and diffs
Enables complete unmerge functionality by restoring original user records
Please review the specification and let me know if you'd like any adjustments before I proceed with implementing the database schema and API code!

User avatar
Is there a way to have visual demo (a video maybe?) with the showcase of the functionality even with the mock secrets, we don't want to expose any real secrets in the presentation

Great idea! Since we can't create videos directly, let me suggest the best approaches for creating a compelling visual demo for your hackathon presentation:

üé• Recommended Demo Approaches:
1. Live API Demo with Postman/Insomnia
Import the OpenAPI spec from https://002a766d9c56ae8d27dff6be.fp.dev/openapi.json
Create a collection with pre-configured requests
Show the complete workflow live during presentation
2. Screen Recording Tools
Here are the key demo flows to record:

Flow 1: Duplicate Detection

# 1. Scan for duplicates
POST https://002a766d9c56ae8d27dff6be.fp.dev/api/deduplicate/scan
{
  "dry_run": true,
  "batch_size": 100
}

# Shows: 2 duplicate groups found with john.doe@example.com
Flow 2: Smart Merge with Channel Preservation

# 2. Merge duplicates
POST https://002a766d9c56ae8d27dff6be.fp.dev/api/deduplicate/merge
{
  "primary_user_id": "user_456",
  "duplicate_user_ids": ["user_123"],
  "merge_strategy": "most_recent"
}

# Shows: Channels preserved, diff stored, deduplication_history created
Flow 3: Unmerge Capability

# 3. View merge operation
GET https://002a766d9c56ae8d27dff6be.fp.dev/api/operations/1

# 4. Unmerge users
POST https://002a766d9c56ae8d27dff6be.fp.dev/api/deduplicate/unmerge
{
  "merge_operation_id": 1,
  "restore_original_users": true
}

# Shows: Complete restoration of original user records
3. Browser-Based Demo
Visit the Fiberplane interface at: https://002a766d9c56ae8d27dff6be.fp.dev/fp/

This gives you a beautiful API explorer interface that's perfect for live demos!

4. Create Demo Script

Exact API calls to make
Expected responses to highlight
Key talking points for each step
Mock data explanations
5. Quick Demo Video Tools:
Loom - Great for quick screen recordings
OBS Studio - Free, professional recording
Postman - Has built-in request history perfect for demos
üéØ Key Demo Highlights to Showcase:
"Look, we found duplicates!" - Show the scan results
"Smart merge preserves everything" - Show the deduplication_history JSON
"Complete audit trail" - Show the operations endpoint
"Undo any mistake" - Demonstrate the unmerge functionality
"Automatic processing" - Show webhook simulation
Would you like me to create a detailed demo script with the exact API calls and responses you should highlight? This would make it super easy to create a compelling video demo! üé¨




User avatar
Can you create the video or I need to create it manually?

I can't create videos directly - I don't have video creation capabilities. You'll need to create the demo video manually using screen recording tools.

However, I can make this super easy for you! Let me create a detailed demo script with exact steps, API calls, and what to highlight:

üìã Complete Demo Script
Setup (30 seconds)
Open browser to: https://002a766d9c56ae8d27dff6be.fp.dev/fp/
Say: "This is our Braze User Deduplication System with smart merging capabilities"
Scene 1: Show the Problem (45 seconds)
Navigate to: GET /api/duplicates/potential
Click "Try it out" ‚Üí "Execute"
Highlight the response:
{
  "potential_duplicates": [
    {
      "users": [
        {
          "external_id": "user_123",
          "email": "john.doe@example.com",
          "channel": "website"
        },
        {
          "external_id": "user_456",
          "email": "john.doe@example.com",
          "channel": "facebook"
        }
      ],
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "matching_fields": ["email", "phone"]
    }
  ]
}
Say: "See? Same user from website and Facebook - classic duplicate problem!"
Scene 2: Smart Merge (60 seconds)
Navigate to: POST /api/deduplicate/merge
Use this payload:
{
  "primary_user_id": "user_456",
  "duplicate_user_ids": ["user_123"],
  "merge_strategy": "most_recent"
}
Highlight the response - this is the magic:
{
  "success": true,
  "channels_preserved": ["facebook", "website"],
  "deduplication_history": {
    "merged_users": [
      {
        "user_id": "user_123",
        "channel": "website",
        "diff": {
          "first_name": {"old": "John", "new": "Johnny"}
        }
      }
    ],
    "channels": ["facebook", "website"]
  }
}
Say: "Look! We kept the latest info BUT preserved the channel history and differences!"
Scene 3: Audit Trail (30 seconds)
Navigate to: GET /api/operations
Show the merge operation record
Say: "Complete audit trail - we know exactly what happened and when"
Scene 4: Unmerge Magic (45 seconds)
Navigate to: POST /api/deduplicate/unmerge
Use payload: {"merge_operation_id": 1, "restore_original_users": true}
Show successful unmerge
Say: "Made a mistake? No problem - complete undo functionality!"
Scene 5: Automation (30 seconds)
Navigate to: POST /api/webhooks/braze/user-created
Show webhook payload example
Say: "And it all happens automatically when new users are created!"
üé¨ Recording Tips:
Use Loom (easiest) or OBS Studio (free)
Record in 1080p
Keep it under 3-4 minutes total
Practice the script once before recording
Zoom in on the JSON responses to make them readable
üöÄ Pro Tip:
The Fiberplane interface at /fp/ is perfect for demos - it's clean, professional, and shows your API beautifully!

Would you like me to create an even more detailed script with specific talking points for each API response? This should make creating your demo video straightforward! üìπ

Would you like me to provide you with the exact content of any of these files so you can easily copy-paste them into your GitHub repository?

Pro tip: The live demo URL will be perfect to include in your hackathon submission! üéØ




User avatar
Can you at least pack all these in a zip file I can download? Please include a log file with our whole conversation with timestamps if possible

I don't have the ability to create zip files or generate downloadable files - I can only work within the Cloudflare Workers environment and create the specific files (SPEC.md, src/index.ts, src/db/schema.ts) that are part of the project structure.

However, I can help you get organized! Here's what I recommend:

üìã Manual Collection Process:
1. View and Copy Each File:
You can view each file using the browser developer tools or by making API calls to your deployed service:

SPEC.md: I can show you the full content
src/index.ts: I can show you the full content
src/db/schema.ts: I can show you the full content
2. Conversation Log:
Unfortunately, I can't generate a log file with timestamps of our conversation - that would need to be done from your end by copying the chat history.

3. Quick File Export:
Let me show you the current content of each file so you can easily copy them:

Would you like me to display the full content of:

SPEC.md - The project specification
src/index.ts - The main API and website code
src/db/schema.ts - The database schema
Then you can copy-paste each one into your local files and create your GitHub repository manually.

Alternative: You could also use the Fiberplane interface at https://002a766d9c56ae8d27dff6be.fp.dev/fp/ to explore and potentially export the API structure.

Which files would you like me to display first? üìÅ




User avatar
OK, first generate a log file name conversation.ia.log with our conversation and timestamps

I don't have the ability to create a conversation log file - I can only create the specific project files (SPEC.md, src/index.ts, src/db/schema.ts) using the createFile tool.

The createFile tool is restricted to only these three paths:

SPEC.md
src/index.ts
src/db/schema.ts
I cannot create arbitrary files like "conversation.ia.log" or any other file types. This is a limitation of the development environment I'm working in.

üìã What I CAN do:
Show you the full content of each project file so you can copy them
Help you organize the information for your GitHub repository
Provide templates for package.json, README.md, etc.
üí° For the conversation log:
You'll need to manually copy our chat history from this interface. Most browsers allow you to:

Select all text in the chat
Copy and paste into a text file
Save it as conversation.log
Would you like me to display the full content of the three project files so you can easily copy them to your local machine and create your GitHub repository?

Let's start with SPEC.md - shall I show you the complete specification file? üìÑ




User avatar
Yes please

Viewing
SPEC.md
Perfect! Here's the complete SPEC.md file content. You can copy this entire specification.

Now let me show you the src/db/schema.ts file:

Viewing
src/db/schema.ts
Great! Here's the complete src/db/schema.ts file content.

Now let me show you the main src/index.ts file (this will be longer):

Viewing
src/index.ts
The file is quite long. Let me get the rest of it in chunks:
